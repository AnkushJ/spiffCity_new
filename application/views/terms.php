              <p> Get Spiffed, LLC, a Delaware corporation ("Get Spiffed"), owns and operates a service that enables our members to accumulate points as a reward for purchasing offers and performing other activities on our website, mobile apps and affiliated sites.  The Get Spiffed Get Spiffed model also enables their social media contacts within our program to earn credits in the form of (“Points”)  for actions of other members administered through a website located at <a target="_blank" href="https://getspiffed.com">https://getspiffed.com </a> and/or co-branded or customized sites (each, a "Site", and together with the Program, the "Services") operated on behalf of a loyalty marketing partner (each, a "Partner").             
              </p>
              
              <p>  This Terms of Use Agreement, as may be modified from time to time ("Agreement"), constitutes legally binding terms and applies to your use of the Services. By accessing, using, registering for or enrolling in the Services, you agree to be bound by this Agreement, whether you are a "Visitor" (which means that you simply browse the Services, including, without limitation, through a mobile or other wireless device, or otherwise use the Services without being registered) or you are a "Member" (which means that you have registered for the Services). The term "User" refers to a Visitor or a Member, as well as users of other social media services such as Twitter or Facebook with whom you communicate in the course of participating in the Program. You are authorized to use the Services (regardless of whether your access or use is intended) only if you agree to abide by all applicable laws, rules and regulations ("Applicable Law") and the terms of this Agreement. In addition, in consideration for becoming a Member and/or making use of the Services, you must indicate your acceptance of this Agreement during the registration process </p>
              
              <p>  We reserve the right to modify this Agreement at any time and from time to time, and each such modification shall be effective upon posting on the Services. All material modifications will apply prospectively only. Your continued use of the Services following any such modification constitutes your agreement to be bound by and your acceptance of the Agreement as so modified. It is therefore important that you review this Agreement regularly. If you do not agree to be bound by this Agreement and to abide by all Applicable Law, you must discontinue use of the Services immediately. You may receive a copy of this Agreement by contacting us. 
              </p>
             <ol> 
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Eligibility.</strong> Use of the Services and registration to be a Member is void where prohibited. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that (a) all registration information you submit is truthful and accurate; (b) you will maintain the accuracy of such information; (c) you are at least 21 years of age or older; (d) your use of the Services does not violate any Applicable Law. Get Spiffed reserves the right to limit enrollment at any time. Corporations or other business entities are not eligible to become Members. Program membership and use is limited to one individual per Get Spiffed account. Get Spiffed allows only one email address per Member. 
                </p>
              </li>
              
              <li> <p> <strong>Earning Points.</strong> Program terms will vary depending on the Partner involved. As a condition of earning Points, you agree to comply at all times with the terms of all applicable Get Spiffed and Partner offers, promotions, and programs, which terms are hereby incorporated by reference. In general, Members may earn Points by transmitting a Partner's offer or promotion to their social media contacts using social media such as Twitter or Facebook. Get Spiffed will generate unique URLs for promotional offers to be transmitted by Members, enabling Get Spiffed to credit the Member's account the applicable number of Points. Get Spiffed is under no obligation to provide Members with any particular number of Point-earning opportunities or send messages to them. Get Spiffed is not responsible and assumes no liability for changes or discontinuances of service from Partners which may affect offers or the accrual of Points. You are responsible for ensuring that Points earned are properly credited. If you believe that Points have been earned but not properly credited, you may be required to submit documentation or other proof satisfactory to Get Spiffed. </p></li>
              
              <li> <p> <strong>Redeeming Points. </strong>Points may be redeemed only for rewards as offered through Get Spiffed and its Partners at the time of redemption. Points have no cash value. Get Spiffed and its Partners are not responsible for lost or stolen rewards once issued. Rewards are subject to change at any time without notice. The number of Points required to redeem for a reward is subject to change at any time without notice. Points will be subtracted from a Member's account once the redemption order is placed by the Member and captured by the Get Spiffed system. Once used to claim a reward, Points will not be reinstated to the Member's account. You agree to confirm that all information in your personal profile is up-to-date and accurate as of the time of any redemption. </p></li>
              
              <li> <p> <strong>Expiration; Inactive Accounts.</strong> ALL UNUSED POINTS WILL EXPIRE TWELVE (12) MONTHS AFTER ISSUANCE. GET SPIFFED SHALL HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO NOTIFY OR REMIND MEMBERS OF THE UPCOMING EXPIRATION OF ANY UNUSED POINTS. Get Spiffed reserves the right to cancel or disable accounts and expire unredeemed Points in those accounts that are inactive for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months. Get Spiffed reserves the right to limit the opportunities to earn Points available to Members while they remain inactive. </p></li>
              
              <li> <p> <strong>Non-Transferability.</strong> Members' right to use the Program is non-transferable. Points are non-transferable and shall be void if transferred. Points and/or rewards may not be bartered or sold. Get Spiffed accounts and Points are not transferable upon death or as part of a domestic relations matter or otherwise by operation of law. </p></li>
              
              <li> <p> <strong>Term.</strong> This Agreement, and any posted revision to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect while you use the Services or are a Member.

              <li> <p> <strong>Fees.</strong> You acknowledge that Get Spiffed reserves the right to charge for any portion of the Services and to change its fees (if any) from time to time in its discretion. If we terminate your Membership because you have breached the Agreement, you shall not be entitled to the refund of any unused portion of any such fees or payments. </p></li>
              
              <li> <p> <strong>Password.</strong> When you sign up to become a Member, you may also be asked to choose a password. You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password.

              <li> <p> <strong>Prohibited Conduct.</strong> You agree not to abuse Get Spiffed privileges by conduct which is detrimental to the interests of the Program, Get Spiffed or any Partner, including without limitation attempting to accrue Points or spend Points in a manner inconsistent with the Program rules or intent of this Agreement, having multiple accounts, attempting to earn Points through other than legitimate channels, participating in purchasing or redemption fraud, or tampering with award links, etc. Get Spiffed reserves the right to terminate or disable, at our sole discretion, any Get Spiffed membership if we believe such Member has violated or acted inconsistently with the Program rules or intent of this Agreement. Disabling or termination of membership may result in a Member's inability to redeem or earn Points and/or in the cancellation of all of the Member's Points. Get Spiffed shall be the sole determiner in cases of suspected abuse, fraud, or violation of its rules and any decision it makes relating to termination of membership (including cancellation of Points) shall be final and binding. Get Spiffed reserves the right to adjust your Point balance with award reversals for items returned or transactions not completed or cancelled. </p></li>
